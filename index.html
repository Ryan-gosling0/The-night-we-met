    <center><h1>Kawther</h1>
        <span><p>To kawther. sinse the day we met i've been thinking, this "stranger" that popped in my life is making me happy. did i finally find the one, my soulmate? i find myself smiling when i see her smile, my mood changes when i see her. the first week of us haging out in the gym i couldn't even remember her whole face well cuz her eyes were so beutiful i couldn't look at her face, so mismerising they were brown and chnaged slightly greenish and like honey when she stood up in the sun.
            she had this hair i can't describe what color it was i think it was brown and so bright it looked magical, she put it in a bun and when she let it out i melted every time.
        suddenly i want to know everything about her she said she got her father's nose that's cute. she is 2 years younger and she likes bikes, i do too.
    she had this perfect body with her muscles and her strong biceps, she curls more that me, i loved that. our fisrt date at the beach we saw some moving objects in the sky, we joked about getting abducted and killed by aliens. but at that moment i was ready to die cuz she was by my side it was so peaceful i felt like i've lived enough and seen it all. when we hug me i feel safe. her soft and worm skin reminds of when i was a baby. i find myself thinking about her every secend im not doing anything even when training,praying and in every song i listen to.i dont even know if she has feelings for me i just know i like her so mush and i would do everything i could to see her happy because she's my happiness, my sunshine and my all. i hope this letter keeps our passion alive when we're apart <br> <span>Love Hammoudy</span> </p></span>
